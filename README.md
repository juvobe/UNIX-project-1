# UNIX-project-1
The first OS course project. A program that reverses a file (per line) and outputs it to the terminal or a file.

As the first project I created the warmup to C reverse program. Everything in the program works as instructed and all error scenarios listed are considered in the code.
The actual functionality of the program mainly works through a linked list, which the file is first read into, and the output is then written from.
